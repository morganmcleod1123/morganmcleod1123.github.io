										<h1>About Me</h1>

									<p></p>
									<p>My name is Morgan McLeod, and I enjoy turning ideas into reality with computer science. From printing "Hello World" in my first programming class
										to writing an undefeated Chess AI 4 years later, my interest has only grown with my level of knowledge. 
									</p>
										After graduating <em>cum laude</em> in the field of Computer Science from Hendrix College, I went to work for the Arkansas Department of Agriculture,
										where I have been for the past 2 years. There, I have worked in small groups to query, clean, and analyze agricultural data from various sources.
										From there, we present the data in readable reports like the Arkansas Weekly Market Summary, which has a readership of over 4000.
									</p>
									<p>
										Though I have learned invaluable technical and workplace skills from my time at the ADA, I am now looking to further my growth in software engineering.
										I will be simultaneously applying for software engineering positions as well as working on interesting projects to hone my programming skills.
									</p>
									<p>
										Thank you for taking the time to give my portfolio a look through. If you want to see more about my career growth or the interesting projects that I
										will continue to work on, keep an eye on this site, my LinkedIn, or my GitHub.
